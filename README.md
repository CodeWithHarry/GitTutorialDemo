This is a repository for explaining git on CodeWithHarry

Git is a distributed version-control system for tracking changes in source code during software development. It is designed for coordinating work among programmers, but it can be used to track changes in any set of files. Its goals include speed, data integrity, and support for distributed, non-linear workflows.
Why is it so important?
If you are a coder/ programmer/ developer, you have to know Git.
1)Most importantly, your code is saved for life. You can't lose it.
2)Suppose, you and your friend are working a project/software and want to make some modifications, how would you do so?
3)Git allows developers to download a new version of the software/project/code/file, make changes, and upload the newest revision.
4)You can track each and every change in the source code and check how it looked 1 day, 1 month, 1 year, or 10 years before.
5)You can look for people working on similar projects and work with them.
6)Contributing to an open source is such great exposure to one. It makes you future ready for the Tech industry.
